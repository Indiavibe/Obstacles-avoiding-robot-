Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up mining on Raspbian OS on a full Raspberry Pi 4:

*Software Requirements:*

1. Raspbian OS (latest version)
2. CPUMiner or MinerGate software

*Setup and Configuration:*

1. Install Raspbian OS on your Raspberry Pi 4.
2. Update and upgrade Raspbian: `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`
3. Install CPUMiner or MinerGate software:
    - CPUMiner: `sudo apt-get install cpuminer`
    - MinerGate: `sudo apt-get install minergate`
4. Configure the mining software:
    - CPUMiner: `cpuminer.conf` file (set your mining pool, username, and password)
    - MinerGate: Follow the setup wizard
5. Start mining:
    - CPUMiner: `cpuminer` command
    - MinerGate: Click the "Start Mining" button

*Optimization:*

1. Overclock your Raspberry Pi 4: `sudo raspi-config` (enable overclocking and set to "High" or "Turbo")
2. Disable unnecessary services: `sudo systemctl disable` (e.g., `sudo systemctl disable bluetooth`)
3. Adjust CPU frequency: `sudo cpufreq-set -g performance`

*Monitoring:*

1. Install monitoring tools: `sudo apt-get install htop` and `sudo apt-get install stress`
2. Monitor CPU usage: `htop` command
3. Monitor system temperature: `vcgencmd measure_temp` command

*Notes:*

- Mining cryptocurrency consumes significant power and generates heat. Ensure proper cooling and a reliable power supply.
- This setup is for educational purposes only, as the profitability of mining on a Raspberry Pi 4 is limited.
- Be aware of your power consumption and adjust your setup accordingly.

Remember to research and understand the terms and conditions of your chosen mining pool and the cryptocurrency you're mining.
